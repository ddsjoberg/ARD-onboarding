- OVERVIEW OF OUR ERROR MESSAGING STRATEGY

- GIVE EXAMPLES OF THE AMAZING {cli} TOOLS

- REVIEW THE `cli::cli_abort(call)` ARGUMENT AND HOW IT AFFECTS MESSAGING.

- DO WE IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED setting of the env when the function is called? I think it's a good idea, but as it's brand new, there could be kinks that need ironing out that I don't know about. I do want to implement, and perhaps it's easier to do it before we onbaord everyone.
