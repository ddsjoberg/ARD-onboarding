### General Structure for Unit Testing

- Use small unit testing chunks `test_that("<descriptive text>", {...})`

- While it can be different for various functions, but one chunk per function argument is often sufficient

- Be purposeful when creating snapshot tests. For example, if you're testing an ARD object correctly captured the error messages, you don't need to snapshot the entire ARD data frame.

- Do not snapshot printed tibbles or card objects. Each of these has a print method that truncates rows and columns, which will not be captured in a snapshot. Moreover, we don't want small changes to a print method to break snapshot tests.

- Snapshot tests must be human readable. Note that I DO NOT consider a printed data frame with breaks across the column to be human readable. If needed, break a snapshot test into chunks, e.g. snapshot the first few columns, followed by a snapshot with the remaining columns.

- REVIEW THE SNAPS BEFORE COMMITTING. Not only are you going to inspect the results in the console while writing a snapshot test, you must also review the actual snapshot test. Pay particular attention to these notes from tidyselect, that for now, will only appear in a testing frame work (i.e. when unit tests are run in their own environment, not interactively).

    ```r
      Warning:
      Use of .data in tidyselect expressions was deprecated in tidyselect 1.2.0.
      i Please use `"variable_level"` instead of `.data$variable_level`
    ```
    
    You can use the `options(lifecycle_verbosity = "error")` option to convert these testing-only messages to errors, which makes them much easier to track down.

- Should each snapshot test live in its own chunk? That will give a proper heading to each of the snapshots, so we know what is being tested by that snapshot.

### Testing Error Messages

There are various ways to check appropriate error messaging, and snapshot testing is my favorite.
This ensures the exact error you're planning for is the one returned.

```r
expect_snapshot(
  error = TRUE, 
  <expr>
)
```

### Note about the future

We have a somewhat complex messaging situation. {cards} functions are going to be called from {cardx} and {gtsummary}: in these cases, we want the user to be messaged about the function they ran, even if the error is thrown from {cards}.

In the near future, we'll be implementing something like this:

``` r
# set this function at the top of a user-facing function
set_cli_abort_call <- function(env = rlang::caller_env()) {
  if (getOption("cli_abort_call") |> is.null()) {
    options(cli_abort_call = env)
    withr::defer(expr = options(cli_abort_call = NULL), envir = env)
  }
  invisible()
}

# use this function in `cli_abort(call=get_cli_abort_call())`
get_cli_abort_call <- function() {
  getOption("cli_abort_call", default = parent.frame())
}

# function called by user
user_facing_function <- function() {
  set_cli_abort_call()
  check_for_errors()
}

# an internal function OR exported function from another pkg that throws the error
check_for_errors <- function() {
  cli::cli_abort(c("!" = "This is an error!", "i" = "Be better"), call = get_cli_abort_call())
}

# this exhibits the user experience
user_facing_function()
#> Error in `user_facing_function()`:
#> ! This is an error!
#> ℹ Be better

# check the default still work when no option is set
check_for_errors()
#> Error in `check_for_errors()`:
#> ! This is an error!
#> ℹ Be better
```
