# Overview

The CDISC Analysis Results Data (ARD) Model is an emerging standard for
encoding statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format. Its
primary objective is to streamline the processes of automation, ensuring
reproducibility, promoting reusability, and enhancing traceability.

The {cards} R package offers a range of functions for ARD generation,
from basic univariate summaries like means and tabulations to complex
multivariable summaries encompassing regression models and statistical
tests.

The package includes functionalities to represent results in various
formats, including JSON and YAML. Thanks to its flexible structures, the
{cards} package can be harnessed in diverse applications, such as
generating tables for regulatory submissions and conducting quality
control checks on existing tables. Furthermore, the {cards} ARD object
can be accessed through a REST API, allowing writers to dynamically
incorporate table results into reports.

The {cardx} package (extra cards) is a companion to {cards}, exporting
more complex functions to generate ARD objects. While {cards} package
has minimal dependencies, the {cardx} package will include additional
suggested package dependencies.

While {cards} calculates statistics and stores them in a structured
object, it cannot present those results; this, however, is where the
{gtsummary} package shines. The {gtsummary} package offers a modular
framework to construct summary tables. It is the most widely used
package for summary tables in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space, and
won the American Statistical Association's 2021 award for Innovation in
Statistical Programming and Analytics. The {gtsummary} package is
currently being refactored to utilize {cards} as its backend, which will
allow users to both extract an ARD object from a {gtsummary} table and
use an ARD object to construct a {gtsummary} table. The {cards} and
{gtsummary} packages stand as robust and versatile tools, poised to
assist in a multitude of analytical endeavors.

# Pre-work

Before we meet to review the details, please complete the following:

1.  Review the full Analysis Results Standard, paying particular
    attention to the section on Analysis Results Data.
    -   CDISC webinar on the model:
        <https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/analysis-results-standard-public-review>
1.  Review the {gtsummary} package.
    -   Cornell Seminar:
        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tANo9E1SYJE&t=5s>
1.  Using the {cards} package, create a single ARD object that contains
    all the statistics needed to construct the table below (including
    the statistics in the header).
    -   Use the `cards::ADSL` data set.
    -   Use `cards::ard_continuous()` and `cards::ard_cateogrical()` to
        calculate the statistics.
    -   Use `cards::bind_ard()` to combine the results into a single ARD
        object.
