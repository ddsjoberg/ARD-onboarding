title: "Build {gtsummary} with ARDs"

We will use the `tbl_summary()` function to illustrate how to build a new gtsummary table.

Imagine we wish to construct the table below: it can be done both by passing a data frame to `tbl_summary()` or an ARD to `card_summary()`. 
These functions share most of their internals.


```{r}
library(gtsummary)
library(cards)

tbl_summary(
  trial, 
  by = trt, 
  include = c(marker, age, grade),
  type = age ~ "continuous2",
  statistic = all_continuous2() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})", "{median} ({p25}, {p75})"),
  missing = "no"
)

# build the ARD with the {cards} package
ard_for_table <- 
  ard_stack(
    trial,
    ard_continuous(variables = c(marker, age)),
    ard_categorical(variables = grade),
    .by = trt,
    .missing = TRUE,                     # we use missing information in gtsummary
    .attributes = TRUE,                  # we also use attributes like column labels
    .total_n = TRUE                      # add total N to the ARD
  )

# then convert it to a table with `card_summary()`
ard_for_table |> 
  tbl_ard_summary(
    by = trt,
    type = age ~ "continuous2",
    statistic = all_continuous2() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})", "{median} ({p25}, {p75})")
  )
```
