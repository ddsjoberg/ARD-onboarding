We will use the `tbl_summary()` function to illustrate how to build a new gtsummary table.

Imagine we wish to construct the table below: it can be done both by passing a data frame to `tbl_summary()` or an ARD to `card_summary()`. 
These functions share most of their internals.


```{r}
library(gtsummary)
library(cards)

tbl_summary(
  trial, 
  by = trt, 
  include = c(marker, age, grade),
  type = age ~ "continuous2",
  statistic = all_continuous2() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})", "{median} ({p25}, {p75})"),
  missing = "no"
)

# build the ARD with the {cards} package
ard_for_table <- 
  ard_stack(
    trial,
    .by = trt,
    ard_continuous(variables = c(marker, age)),
    ard_categorical(variables = grade),
    .missing = TRUE,                     # we use missing information in gtsummary
    .attributes = TRUE                   # we also use attirbutes like column labels
  )

# then convert it to a table with `card_summary()`
ard_for_table |> 
  card_summary(
    type = age ~ "continuous2",
    statistic = all_continuous2() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})", "{median} ({p25}, {p75})"),
    missing = "no"
  )
```

### Building Tables

The `brdg_*()` and `pier_*()` functions help us build gtsummary tables.

For the table above, we have one 

```{r}
brdg_tbl <- ard_for_table |> 
  brdg_summary(
    by = "trt", 
    variables = c("marker", "age", "grade"),
    type = list(marker = "continuous", age = "continuous2", grade = "categorical"),
    statistic = 
      list(
        marker = "{median} ({p25}, {p75})",
        age = c("{mean} ({sd})", "{median} ({p25}, {p75})"), 
        grade = "{n} / {N}"
      )
  )
names(brdg_tbl)
brdg_tbl
```

The pier functions are used by the bridge function.

For example `gtsummary::pier_summary_continuous()` built this portion of the `.$table_body`.

```{r}
brdg_tbl$table_body |> 
  dplyr::filter(variable == "marker")
```

`gtsummary::pier_summary_continuous2()` built this portion of the `.$table_body`.

```{r}
brdg_tbl$table_body |> 
  dplyr::filter(variable == "age")
```

and `gtsummary::pier_summary_categorical()` built this section.

```{r}
brdg_tbl$table_body |> 
  dplyr::filter(variable == "grade")
```

These three structures provide the basis for most table structures.
