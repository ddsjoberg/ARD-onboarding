title: "Standalone Scripts"
editor: source
---

The package utilizes a few standalone scripts that are used across a few projects, including {cards}, {cardx}, and {gtsummary}.
Some of these scripts make available shims for common tidyverse functions, so you can use the function without depending on the package.
The `"checks"` script is a series of functions to check the argument values supplied by users, and provides informative error messages when the values are not valid.
Do not make changes to these files directly: rather, update these files in their source location.

- `import-standalone-purrr.R`: https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/blob/main/R/standalone-purrr.R
- `import-standalone-forcats.R` https://github.com/ddsjoberg/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-forcats.R
- `import-standalone-stringr.R` https://github.com/ddsjoberg/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-stringr.R
- `import-standalone-checks.R` https://github.com/ddsjoberg/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-checks.R

After the update has been made, you can copy the file into the repo with 

```r
usethis::use_standalone("r-lib/rlang", file = "purrr")
usethis::use_standalone("ddsjoberg/standalone", file = "forcats")
usethis::use_standalone("ddsjoberg/standalone", file = "stringr")
usethis::use_standalone("ddsjoberg/standalone", file = "checks")
```
