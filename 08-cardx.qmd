The [{cards}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/) package exports many utilities for working with ARD objects.
Additionally, [{cards}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/) exports utilities for creating new `ard_*()` functions.
The [{cardx}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cardx/) package takes advantage of this infrastructure, and exports many other functions for creating more complex ARD objects.

Utilizing these utilities from [{cards}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/), we can easily create a function to prepare the results from a t-test.

```{r}
cards::ADSL |> 
  # keep two treatment arms for the t-test calculation
  dplyr::filter(ARM %in% c("Placebo", "Xanomeline High Dose")) |> 
  cardx::ard_ttest(by = ARM, variable = AGE)
```

The utilities allow us to return, not only the results of the t-test, but rows for each of the arguments.
This allows us to both report the results, and also in a re-use case, know exactly how the results were calculated, e.g. assuming equal variances, the level of the confidence interval, etc.

Essentially, every new `ard_*()` function we write, will be added to {cardx} rather than {cards}.

For our ARD work, we will take advantage of the {broom} package **and we will use the naming conventions** from {broom}.
The {broom} package get 500K+ installs every month.
With an enormous user base, we can be confident in the results.
